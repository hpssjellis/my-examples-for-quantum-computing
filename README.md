# tfQuantumJs
An Attempt to combine TensorflowJS with Quantum Javascript



## Tuesday Oct 6th, 2020. This will probably not work, but fun to try.


but first load the 

## Gitpod of this Github at (right click open in new window, needs you to have a github login) https://gitpod.io/#github.com/hpssjellis/tfQuantumJs

Note: This gitpod installs everything and autoloads the entire googleCollab in one file, which seems to work. The one file is A05train01.py


# Installation

The gitpod installs everything and starts the mnist-quantum example.
You can ctlr-C to stop it if you want.
It or other examples when made can be run with
```
python3 a05train01.py

```
For simplicity line 200 has been commented out for a shorter number of batchs = 3 change it back for the longer run

Having some issues getting matlablib to make plots while running.

To make the above python program I converted the ipython notebook by opening up the 
folders quantum --> docs --> tutorials and typing

```

jupyter nbconvert --to script mnist.ipynb

```
It will output mnist.txt and you can change it to mnist.py. A few of the first commands need to be changed.

First Issue. Q.js is a playground, can't seem to figure out how to make my own javascript pages
