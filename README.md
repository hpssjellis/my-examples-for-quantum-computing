# tfQuantumJs
An Attempt to combine TensorflowJS with Quantum Javascript



## Tuesday Oct 6th, 2020. This will probably not work, but fun to try.


but first load the 

# Gitpod of this Github at (right click open in new window, needs you to have a github login) https://gitpod.io/#github.com/hpssjellis/tfQuantumJs

Note: This gitpod installs everything and autoloads the entire googleCollab in one file, which seems to work. The one file is A05train01.py
